# 16S rRNA Microbiome Analysis Pipeline (QIIME2–PICRUSt2–LEfSe)

This repository provides scripts and command logs for 16S rRNA gene sequencing data processing and analysis.

---

## Overview

The workflows include the following analytical steps:

- **QIIME2** – preprocessing, denoising, and diversity analysis  
- **PICRUSt2** – functional pathway prediction  
- **LEfSe** – differential taxa identification

## Analysis Scripts

The main command logs are included in this repository:

- `qiime2_pipeline.sh` – QIIME2 data processing and diversity analyses  
- `picrust2_command_log.txt` – PICRUSt2 functional prediction steps  
- `LEfSe_command_log.txt` – LEfSe differential abundance analysis  

These files document the essential steps used for sequence analysis.
